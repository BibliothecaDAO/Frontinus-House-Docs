### Project Detail

-  **What is the name of the project:** Fully Composable, Incentive, and Decentralized Lootverse Collaboration and Creation Network

-  **What is it based upon:** It will be based on Lootverse to enrich the Lootverse ecosystem and empower the development of games in Lootverse

-  **What does this do that is unique or different to other projects:**

  Based on the original Loot NFT with a few gaming words, many derivative projects like new NFTs and games come out to expand those words and form collective narration. They form a prosperous ecosystem called Lootverse, which is crucial to the value of Loot. Therefore, we should support the following projects in Lootverse in any ways as much as possible to promote their development, and their success can also make Loot more valuable. However, under the current mode of Lootverse, the original project and its following new project are essentially seperate except sharing the same gaming words without further mutual benefits.

  To address this issue, we aim at enabling the open, decentralized, and permisionless upgradability and composability of projects within Lootverse. Each original project can allow any other people to freely upgrade it with new projects, so everyone can freely make new projects to revise and improve the orginal project. Based on the original project, the new project can share the resources with the original project like user network and token model with no need to build from scratch, and get the support from the original project like technical foundation, stakeholder community, and creator economy to grow faster and better. In return, the new project can also make the original project become better, so the original project can attract more users and earn more revenue. As a result, the orginal project and its new projects made by others can help each other for mutual promotion in Lootverse.

- **Who is the target audience of this project**: The followers of the original project like the collectors of the NFT and the players of the game. They want to make the original project better with innovative upgrades, because it will benefit the original project to benefit themselves. However, the founder of the orignal project may not realize the value of their improvements, so they want to fork the original project with new branches to upgrade and improve by themselves.

- **What about this project excites you to build**: We can make Lootverse projects can not just share gaming words and collective stories, but more importantly exchange the more valuable and essential development resources to assist each other for mutual benefit, which makes Lootverse a more capable and thriving community of shared interests.

-  **Any further details you might want to elaborate on:** Take a Lootverse on-chain gaming project for example. The founding team of the original project doesn't need to make a whole game. They can just make a part first like game equipments. Then others can freely add any other parts to the original project like characters and storylines, or just revise the original project such as adding other equipments to upgrade the original project to the new project. Likewise others can also continue upgrading the new project until forming an integrated game. Each project can issue its token, and when buying the whole game, the tokens of all composed projects will also be purchased together, so the earnings of the game will be distributed among all related projects according to their contributions.
