### Project Detail
In partnership with Usiku games, a blockchain game development studio, we are proposing to host a hacker house in Nairobi, Kenya. This will encompass hosting educational meetups, research into creating immutable on-chain games that follow the play2Die model. 

The hacker house will bring together game developers, designers, economists, and other experts to explore the possibilities of play2die games. We will work together to develop new game mechanics, economic models, and marketing strategies.


The hacker house will be hosted at a coworking space in Nairobi and it will run for two weeks. During that time, participants will work on researching and building composable, interconnected games set in the Realms Autonomous World. This will also be a workshop where hackers will get the opportunity to exchange ideas and get hands-on experience with Dojo ECS and build games that are 100% onchain and 100% expressible as a ZK circuit that can be executed by a decentralized blockchain network without any of the nodes having to run any computation.


At the end of the hacker house, participants will present their games to a panel of judges.The judges will select the best games, and the winners will receive prizes.

This hacker house will be unique in that it will focus on research and development of immutable on-chain play2die games. This is a new and emerging field, and there are few other projects that are doing this type of work.


The target audience for this project is game developers, designers, economists, and other experts who are interested in the future of blockchain gaming. The hacker house will provide a forum for these individuals to come together and share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn about the latest trends in play2die gaming. We expect anywhere between 10-50 individual for this event.


### Character

I am a blockchain developer and have been doing research and developing using Zero Knowledge proofs. I have also been a ChainLink community ambassador for over 2 years now and together with Usiku Games, we have hosted a number of hackathons and meetups that have been a great success. Our first Hackathon/Event was hosted in December 2021 and it was sponsored by Harmony. We were able to attract about 35 people for the event where we learnt about Blockchain basics and the Solidity language. In 2022, we held 3 hackathons in partnership with Harmony, Polygon and Celo combined and the participants came up with amazing projects and were able to create a vibrant community of Blockchain developers and researchers.The hallmark of some of these events, like the Polygon events was that we had the cofounders, Mihailo Bjelic and Sandeep Nailwal give talks directly through video conferencing and give insights on the growth of the ecosystem and our role in fueling that growth as developers. This year too was off to a great start. During one of our community meetups in Nairobi, we hosted Vitalik Buterin in-person and it was surreal. We hope to continue with this exciting journey and that is what makes me believe that we are suited for this task at hand.   


### Timeline

We plan on conducting education and research first which will take place from September 17th to September 30th.During this period we will be learning and integrating the onchain games set in the Realms AW at the Usiku Games development Studio. Then we will conduct a hackathon which will run to Oct 7th.
