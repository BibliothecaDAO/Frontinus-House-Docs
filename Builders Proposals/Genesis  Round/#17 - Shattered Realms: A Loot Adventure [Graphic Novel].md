### **Proposal Overview:** 
_Shattered Realms: A Loot Adventure_ is a proposed graphic novel that seeks to explore and expand the Realms ecosystem through compelling character creation and storytelling. It will be a collaborative project involving illustrator Danny Schlitz who has previously worked with Marvel, Disney, Sony, Netflix, NounsDAO, and many more; Adam Fortier, a veteran comic publisher; and BibliothecaDAO member O_Excess, who will oversee writing and script development.

The graphic novel will be made available in both physical and digital editions, creating and/or featuring locations, characters, and resources from the developing Realms universe (e.g., locations from the Realms Atlas or Wonders will also serve as locations within the graphic novel). The graphic novel plot will also allow a variety of narrative hooks for other writers and developers to build upon.

The project has already begun with the first chapter funded by O_Excess. We are seeking the Frontinus grant from BibliothecaDAO to continue production. The intention is for Realms and other Loot-project holders to have a say in crucial storyline decisions, ensuring that the novel reflects the community's interests. 
This initial round of funding will get us through the next two chapters of Shattered Realms, after which we can look to continue the graphic novel through additional external funding, or from sales of the existing material.
Community decision points will be presented through votes within the BibliothecaDAO and Loot Comic Discords.

**Why a Graphic Novel?**
By crafting compelling characters and stories and presenting them through the broadly accessible medium of a graphic novel, Shattered Realms adds a fresh dimension to the Realms world. This appeal extends not only to Realms holders but also to the general public.

Additionally, writers, developers, and game designers within Realms/BibliothecaDAO can benefit from the narrative hooks created by the graphic novel’s storyline. They can integrate, expand, or alter characters, events, or plotlines introduced in the novel, thereby enriching the existing narrative landscape.

The novel's success could act as a catalyst, enhancing the visibility and appeal of the entire Realms universe. This success could stimulate collaborative creativity, driving other projects within the BibliothecaDAO and supporting the collective growth of the community.

**Unique Aspects of the Proposal** 
The Shattered Realms graphic novel introduces several unique components utilizing the blockchain and/or decentralized Realms universe.

- Community-Driven Development: Realms holders will have the opportunity to vote on essential aspects of the novel. Not only does this help engage w/ holders, it ensures the storyline aligns with BibliothecaDAO’s vision.

- Digital Distribution: Adaptation and distribution of the comic via the Macroverse App and platform will bring global accessibility to the series both within and outside the web3 audience.

- Integration with Digital Perks: In collaboration with developers within BibliothecaDAO, digital versions of the comic will be designed to provide unique benefits to comic holders. These benefits can range from cosmetic effects to exclusive access to additional content, fostering a richer and more personalized reading experience. Cosmetic effects are not yet built into the existing Autonomous Worlds infrastructure so this provides a long term goal for the project, though some developers have shown initial interest.

- Physical Claims for Digital Holders: Digital comic holders can claim physical editions. This bridges the gap between the digital and physical worlds, allowing readers to enjoy the novel in their preferred format.

- Expanded print distribution: given existing relationships with the traditional print business, the series will be made available through bookstores and comic shops worldwide.

- NFT Integration: Leveraging the potential of NFTs, the novel could introduce limited edition digital assets representing key characters or artwork. 

**Target Audience**

The Shattered Realms Graphic Novel is written to appeal to a diverse audience. It seeks to engage Realms holders and BibliothecaDAO members by providing holders a voice in shaping the narrative featuring Realms-related locations and themes. It also targets the general public, including fans of fantasy literature, comics, and visual storytelling, opening the Realms universe to a broader readership. The novel's innovative approach also resonates with writers, developers, game designers, and NFT enthusiasts, allowing for further exploration and integration into existing or new projects. 

**Why I'm Excited to Build This**

This comic is over a year in the making, starting with short story writing for the Loot Genesis Scrolls in 2022. This summer proved a turning point with veterans in the comic industry signing on to advise on the project. Funding this project will help make the novel a reality.

- Broad Audience Appeal: Create a novel that resonates not only with the existing Realms community but also attracts a broader audience, including fantasy enthusiasts, comic readers, game developers, and digital art collectors.

- Realms Project Synergy: Collaborate with developers, writers, and designers within the BibliothecaDAO, allowing the novel's content to be integrated into existing and future games and projects within the Realms universe.

- Publishing and Distribution: Secure a publishing deal that aligns with the project's values and ensures a wide distribution of both digital and physical copies, including special provisions for digital holders to claim physical editions.

- Enhancing Visibility: Leverage the novel's success as a catalyst to enhance the visibility and appeal of the entire Realms universe, driving other projects within the BibliothecaDAO and supporting the collective growth of the community.

- Derivative Media: Utilize connections from both the community and the graphic novel producers to generate interest in the project for upsell to film, TV, and gaming. If this is successful, it will further enhance the visibility of the Realms universe beyond what is mentioned above.


### Sample Material

**Graphic Novel Backstory (without giving anything away)**

The Age of Ascension was named because this was when humankind discovered the Arcanium: powerful relics that allowed them to harness supernatural energies and change their positions in the world.

The abilities granted by the equipment varied by form and destructive potential. Some swords cut through stone while others unleashed waves of energy; an Arcanium helmet might be indestructible or allow a person to breathe underwater; a staff might manifest bolts of lightning or conjure foul demons. Often, the true power of these armaments remained dormant for generations until one day the power awakened. And like living things, the armaments seemed to grow. They became stronger or more efficient. Some even seemed to have personalities of their own.

The story of how humans came into possession of such artifacts and where their powers came from was widely debated. Ultimately, humans interpreted their ownership of the armaments as signs that they deserved to rule and it legitimized their sovereignty over the lands and other creatures of Kyrindar.

Of course, these theories were wrong. The artifacts’ powers did not come from the gods, nor were they signs of an innate right to rule. The artifacts were conduits to other worlds, and through their use, the borders between these places weakened.

Humans only knew this in hindsight, for as the borders weakened each artifact's power was increasingly capable of taking more from these other worlds. The artifacts became stronger, the humans who wielded them rose to power, and the cycle intensified.

It wasn’t until the first breach that humans learned that their theories about the world and their place in it were misguided. Lord Sedorik, the Ruler of Sakkes had amassed an arsenal of Arcanium and with it became a conqueror, extending his Realm’s borders further than any king had before. But the expansion was rapid, violent, and oftentimes careless. Rivals emerged and these rivals found recruitment was made easier by the collateral damage from Sedorik’s wars. A fierce civil war began within Sakkes’ borders and some of his former Arcanium-equipped allies challenged his rule. 

The graphic novel begins when members of Lord Sedorik’s Royal Guard are ambushed by assassins. As the two forces battle, something unimaginable occurs that forever alters the landscape of Kyrindar.
