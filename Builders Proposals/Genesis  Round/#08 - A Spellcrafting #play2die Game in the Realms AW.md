### Project Detail

We are currently designing and are looking for a grant to build a play2die game based in the Realms Autonomous World. 

The concept for the game is a time-based spell crafting game. In a single play session you take the role of a mage who is crafting a powerful ritual spell. Initiating a spell requires a sacrifice ($LORDS) and the game requires periodic upkeep from the player in order to continue to increase the spells power and prevent it from descending into chaos and consuming you.

At any point in time there are a number of actions available to the player, some of which take real-world time to complete, and some which require a real-time cool-down period before they can be used again. For example: forage for ingredients, send familiar to hunt, stabilize spell, study, etc. The game is designed for play sessions to last days or weeks with short bursts of attention required from the player a number of times per day. This kind of engagement has been shown to be very popular for mobile games.

The game ends either when you are consumed (die) or if you elect to try and capture the spell in a stable form. Ending the game in the latter way yields a stabilized spell asset unique to this play through. Other game developers may wish to integrate with this asset in the future and assign value to various properties.

The game itself takes inspiration from digital pets like Tamagotchi, but also spell crafting games such as Magic: The Gathering. It is targeted at casual gamers as an approachable and low outlay way to engage with the AW using familiar mobile gaming patterns.

For a working document of the full rule set see [this link](https://hackmd.io/7hu-Ng3uRYK9d9ms45sf4w).

The ingredients, history, elemental properties, chaos and power levels allow a spell to be visualized as a procedurally generated arcana circle. Each spell will be unique in its visualization and these can be shared by players

There will also be a leaderboard of current and historically most powerful mages.

We are applying for a grant to:

- Implement the base rules of the game using the Dojo framework
- Implement a simple text-based client
- Gather feedback and iterate on the rules to improve player engagement and overall fun

If this is successful the next phase would be to develop a mobile web client.
