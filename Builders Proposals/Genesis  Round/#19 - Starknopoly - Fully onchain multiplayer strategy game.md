### Project Detail
Starknopoly is a total on chain game like the the game Monopoly. [Monopoly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuWvMgYv03g)
Our team members all like Monopoly very much. We will create a total on chain version that everyone can play it anywhere and anytime. Players can hold their earned assets forever on chain. 
We create the game on Starknet by engine Dojo.
Game Money : $Gold
Players roll the dice and move their roles.
There are three different buildings players can choose to build on land they stand on:
Hotel : Buy and build a hotel by $Gold. When other players stand on your hotel, they should pay hotel fees to you.
Bank : Buy and build a bank by $Gold on land. Bank can accumulate $Gold every block.
Farmland : Buy and build a farmland by $Gold on land. Farmland can product food for player. Player roll the dice and walk need to consume food.
Player can also buy back other players' buildings by spend 130% $Gold of the building price.
This is only the first and simple rules of our beta version. 
In the future, we will create a ultimate monopoly world, where everyone can build many kinds of buildings based on the contracts they use. They can upgrade, trade, destroy buildings and other assets.

### Game Treasury
There is a $Gold treasury in game.There is a 1%~3% tax when players pay hotel fee and buy back fee. The tax will be funded in game treasury. Players can buy $Gold  in treasury by ETH or LORD.  The price is based on the amount of $Gold in treasury. Every player can only buy up to 0.5 ETH totally.
At the end of community competition, all ETH will be refunded to players.
