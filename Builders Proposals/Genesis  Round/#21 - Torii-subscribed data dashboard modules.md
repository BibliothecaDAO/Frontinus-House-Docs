**Project Detail**
[Frontend] Data dashboards composable modules, built to be used with Torii indexer. This is valuable both for gameplay analytics, and debugging when testing. Gameplay-wise this can help users gain better insight into dynamic of games more deeply, and grow users to become more engaged users. Development-wise, this can also help game devs test the architecture design of their Dojo game much more easily, and also makes economic analysis of Dojo/Realms games much easier for game devs and designers during testing. This enables development of more robust and competitive Dojo games more easily than today.
[Backend] Related support needed for data dashboarding such as data subscriptions on Torii.

Key uniqueness: Composable modules with easy subscribing to Torii indexer. Will allow game devs to build dashboards that reflect on-chain states effortlessly.

Audience: Dojo & Realms game devs.

What makes us excited: We are currently excited about Autonomous Worlds and on-chain gaming as a catalyst for true mass-adoption of crypto. We've been building POC Dojo games ourselves, and hope this would be something that can make the development, testing, and tuning of Realms and Dojo games much easier.


**Character**
We're members of the Web3MQ team, with member backgrounds building infrastructure serving video and social applications for over half a decade starting from Web3 era. Our team has been building around StarkNet since beginning of the year, launched a trustless message brokerage relay network as an L3, and been involved in Madara development. 

Being able to transmit and synchronize data accurately and robustly, with low latency, and all the while preserving trustless properties as much as possible has been a consistent theme in these efforts.

We feel this is an effort that can make use of our past experience to serve games and developers in this ecosystem.
