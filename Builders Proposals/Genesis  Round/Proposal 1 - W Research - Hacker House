We are thrilled to announce the upcoming Relams Hacker House - a 4-7 day immersive gathering this October focused on expanding the possibilities of the Relams Autonomous World.

In this mansion provided by AW Research, participants will collaborate intensively to build, experiment, and create new modules and assets for Relams using its powerful SDK and APIs. With full support from the Relams development team, you'll bring your ambitious gaming visions to life.
