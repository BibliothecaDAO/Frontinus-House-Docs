### **Project Detail**

* Gameplay Design

The game is called Mississippi. Welcome to Mississippi for gold prospecting! Compete with others, take on greed, and see who comes out on top!

We hope to create an expansive cavern space, containing abundant resources, which we (miners) need to explore and exploit. Due to limited resources for sustaining life in the cavern, all miners must complete the task of **extracting as many resources** from the cavern as possible within a fixed time limit.

The mapping data is completely stored on the chain, and the dungeon is a cycle opening and constantly changing configuration space.

Miners will move and collect in the dungeon in a grid format. Different miners have different preferences and skills, and they exist in a natural **restraining relationship** with each other. When we see other miners, we need to make behavior assessments based on restraining relationships, to decide whether to loot or evade, share resources, or retain information. After we make the decision, other miners will also make related decisions based on the change.

How to safely search for resources in the cavern, evade attacks from other looters, and transfer at the right time is the most important decision to be made. Your decision results will affect everyone's judgment. Therefore, this will be **a completely open game of confrontation**.

* How we will integrate lootverse

We will **"extract" equipment** from loot, which can give players specific attributes for each round, such as increased speed from boots or damage reduction from armor.

If players possess the relevant NFT, they can directly use the gear, but if they don't have it, they can rent it, with **half of the rent going to the game's treasury** and **the other half to the Loot** **hodlers**.

In the main menu of the game, players will be able to see a small portion of the map, with clear visibility of nearby terrain, resources, and potential enemies (other players). In the top right corner, there will be a larger-scale map for the entirety of the game, where players can review all the places they have explored before, in order to assist with decision-making.

The game will be presented in a 2D pixel style, featuring cute characters as players engage in maneuvering, resource collection, and combat within complex caves.

* Future development

In terms of technology, we plan to enhance player experience with zk to introduce a certain degree of war fog early on in each round, adding a random element to player exploration.

In terms of gameplay, we will further develop in the direction of player co-creation, where players can vote on map design before it officially enters the game. **Designers can then get a cut from profits for each round**.

* What's unique about the game

The game itself is the first **fully on-chain roguelike game** with a strong focus on multiplayer confrontation. Players must make timely strategic choices within the cave to optimally route their way to gold, as the core of the game is competition and rivalry. In addition, it incorporates the fun and excitement of random exploration.

Aside from the fun the game provides in itself, we also aspire to develop a gaming mode that is **co-built by developers**. This could include allowing access to modules such as map design, and allowing developers to participate in key game content. We believe this could create a mutually beneficial relationship between players and developers, with the potential of transforming the game into a truly decentralized economic entity.

### **Character**

I am Echo, an ex TikTok strategist and now a core buidler at LX DAO, an R&D-driven DAO and incubator. I have been researching Web3 for two years and personally invested in two Web3 gaming projects. As a product manager, I worked with Metamask cofounder to develop Mobymask, a decentralized phisher register protocol.

I have a strong passion for developing new game modes, and I believe that autonomous worlds will not only bring about a new business model in gaming, but a whole new economic community. I also hope to participate as a builder in this trend.

### **Timeline**

We estimate a start date of 25/08/2023 and an end date of 31/12/2023, a total of 4 months.
