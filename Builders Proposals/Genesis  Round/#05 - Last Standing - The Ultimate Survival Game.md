# 2. The Game

---

**Pitch & Story**

▶️ Players will have to mint their explorers which will go into the wild building outposts. These outposts will have to be defended from random events that will affect random targets. The proud owner of the last standing outpost reaps a rich pool of $LORDS, sourced from defences setup fees and game initiation. The value of this pool corresponds directly to the total LORDS gathered during gameplay, with a fraction allocated for game developers and Bibliotheca DAO.

The story itself will evolve in the next seasons of the game but game mechanics will stay the same.

**Design Pillars**

▶️ Randomness. 

Low Effort. 

Strategic. 

Based on the Realmverse/Lootverse

Fully On-Chain Game

**Game progression**

▶️ The first release of the game will have 2 main phases:

**Preparation phase** - Players will be able to mint explorers and buy defences for their outposts.

Each defence will grant the outpost 1 extra life.

The amount of defences available will be limited and they can only be purchased during the preparation phase with a Variable Rate Gradual Dutch Auction (will spice things up!)

The preparation phase will last a week or will end as soon as all the explorers have been minted.

**Main game phase** - Once the preparation phase is over, explorers will be sent into the wild trying with the scope of building outposts. Dangerous events will randomly happen which will damage random outposts across the map. When an outpost reach 0 lives is destroyed and is out of the game.

During the main game phase, players can trade outposts and reinforcements between themselves on a secondary market.

The season will end when there is only one outpost standing, which will win the jackpot made of a rich pool of $LORDS, sourced from buying defences and minting explorers.

In future seasons players will be able to:

- Customize the shape and attributes of the maps, to be part of this voting phase you have to own a Realm. 1 Realm = 1 Vote
- Trade non-dead explorers whilst the main game is running
- Explorers that belong to a certain orders can vote to farm a resource which will give a boost to a certain type of defence
- The amount of explorers will change every season based on the amount minted in the previous round.

**Winning and losing conditions** 

▶️ A players loses when an outpost that he/she owns goes to 0 lives.

A player win the game if he/she is the owner of the last outpost standing.

**Look & Feel**

▶️ The game should have a similar look of [[Catan](https://www.catan.com/catan)](https://www.catan.com/catan) board game but much bigger size. The map should be much bigger as each explorers minted will build an outpost on one hex tile on the board. 
The game will be in 2D. Design might change.
