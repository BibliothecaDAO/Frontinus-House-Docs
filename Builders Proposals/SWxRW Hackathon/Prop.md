This proposal makes an adjustment to Frontinus House Round 5. Simply instead of 10 winners the will be 5 winners.

## Adjustment Specifics
The top 5 voted on teams will earn 200k LORDS. This will be split between:
- 100k Immediately
- 100k once proposal detail has been complete.

## Reasoning
The are 11 full proposals and the current setup will allow 10 of them to pass allowing for even subpar proposals to pass. This proposal will also increase the amounts of the winners to 200k LORDS overall - Due to current market conditions this will mean the winnings will remain substantial to the winner.

Overall this proposal creates a more competitive round with higher rewards versus the current setup.

## Execution
This proposal is being run in parallel to the current Frontinus House round and voting will end just before it therefore if this proposal passes the above will be executed with 5 winners, if not the top 10 voted proposals will maintain 100k lORDS each.

Onchain execution will not be changed all funds will be taken from the Frontinus House account as established in [BIP-72](https://snapshot.box/#/sn:0x07bd3419669f9f0cc8f19e9e2457089cdd4804a4c41a5729ee9c7fd02ab8ab62/proposal/43)
