This proposal makes an adjustment to Frontinus House Round 5. Simply instead of 10 winners the will be 5 winners.

## Adjustment Specifics
The top 5 voted on teams will earn 200k LORDS. This will be split between:
- 100k Immediately
- 100k once proposal detail has been complete.

## Reasoning
The are 11 full proposals and the current setup will allow 10 of them to pass allowing for even subpar proposals to pass. This proposal will also increase the amounts of the winners to 200k LORDS overall - Due to current market conditions this will mean the winnings will remain substantial to the winner.

Overall this proposal creates a more competitive round with higher rewards versus the current setup.
