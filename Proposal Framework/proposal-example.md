# BIP-13 - Frontinus House Proposal 1 (Genesis of Frontinus)
The Frontinus House process is a funding mechanism which utilises DAO assets to attract talented builders and to incentivise building within BibliothecaDAO and its current ecosystem.

This current proposal aims are :
-  Pilot the Frontinus House process
-  Fund a wide range of builders to build within the Realms Autonomous World
-  Lockin builders within the ecosystem to synergise with Bibliotheca dao
-  Spread the word of Realms Autonomous World
The proposal will follow the [Frontinus House Charter](https://github.com/Calcutatator/Frontinus-House-Docs/blob/main/Charter.md).
## Outline of the Round
- **Does it require use of a framework/what is that framework**
- **Does it require token gating**
- **What do you wish builders carry out? POCâ€™s, infra, p2d games?**
- **Outline the rules in which builders should adhere**
- **Give examples of what builders could/can create**
## Costs
Up to **X** amount of **CURRENCY** reserved for allocation to builders over the **X** duration of the round. 

This cost is the maximum amount utilised, if funding is not granted for the total amount. Any excess will be returned to BibliothecaDAO.

## Execution
The Frontinus House process has several stages to completion. Beginning on X date the process will begin as follows :
-  **1 week** voting period for delegates will be completed.
-  **2 week** proposal period for builders to apply for grants.
-  **1 week** voting period for delegates to decide on which grantees get accepted.
This will mean the round will be completed on approximately **X** date and all funds will be vested over **X** months.
