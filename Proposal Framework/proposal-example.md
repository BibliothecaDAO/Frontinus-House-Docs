# BIP-13 - Frontinus House Proposal 1 (Genesis of Frontinus)
The Frontinus House process is a funding mechanism which utilises DAO assets to attract talented builders and to incentivise building within BibliothecaDAO and its current ecosystem.

This current proposal aims are :
-  Pilot the Frontinus House process
-  Fund a wide range of builders to build within the Realms Autonomous World
-  Lockin builders within the ecosystem to synergise with Bibliotheca dao
-  Spread the word of Realms Autonomous World

The proposal will follow the [Frontinus House Charter](https://github.com/Calcutatator/Frontinus-House-Docs/blob/main/Charter.md) but will follow an amended version of the Frontinus House Process as detailed within the Voting System Amendment subsection.
## Outline of the Round
This round aims to simply invite builders within the Starknet and surrounding ecosystems to build within the Realms Autonomous World. The are no restriction on who can propose within this round.

The is no theme in this genesis round of Frontinus House. We invite anyone who wishes to build within the Realms Autonomous World to propose an idea they would like to build.

Our community has constructed some fun examples we would like to prompt people to build:
-  AMM front-end (swap tokens, create markets, add liquidity outside of game UI)
-  POC p2d game built upon Eternum (Integrating Eternum assets) 
-  Dashboard of market rates for the exchange of resources
-  In-game chat system or message board
-  Mod to swap orders with other players, form and dissolve alliances
-  Integrate an ecosystem project onto a madara L3

Please do not see these as requirements but prompts as to what could be built.

This round will be intentionally open with few restrictions, each builder **must** fill out the [proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RrimGIyNYauTFixJCd_QaZTEtGp2FsodXkhMt2tH180/edit?usp=sharing) and submit this to the DAO within the timeframes noted under the Execution subsection.

## Costs
Up to **500,000** amount of **$LORDS** reserved for allocation to builders over the **3 week** duration of the round. 

  *This will equal five available grants of 100,000 Lords*

This cost is the maximum amount utilised, if funding is not granted for the total amount. Any excess will be returned to BibliothecaDAO.

## Execution
The Frontinus House process has several stages to completion. Beginning on 10/08/2023 the process will begin as follows :
-  **0 week** voting period for delegates will be completed.
-  **2 week** proposal period for builders to apply for grants.
-  **1 week** voting period for delegates to decide on which grantees get funded.

This will mean the round will be completed on approximately **31/08/2023** at this point 50% of the funds will be vested over **3** months to the accepted builders then on completion of the objectives defined within the proposal the further 50% will be released to the builder and vested over a further **3** months.

### Voting System Amendment
The Genesis Round will have an amended voting period process. Instead of an in app voting system, we will use a simple emoji based vote within the [Realms x Bibliotheca DAO](https://discord.gg/bibliothecadao) discord for Realm holders. This will mean each Realm NFT holder will only hold single voting power per proposal. Builders with the top  approval rating will receive the grants.

Approval rating will be calculated as a percentage of total votes on each proposal. Example - 100 votes with 60 for and 40 against will mean a 60% approval rating. 

A proposal must meet these two requirements:
-  A minimum of 50% approval rating (Proposal must get consensus approval)
-  Greater than 20% of votes of the most voted proposal (Proposals will have a reasonable quorum)
