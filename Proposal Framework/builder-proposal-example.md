### Project Detail
I would like to propose the Briq Biblio Eiffel tower. The Briq Builders team will by had build the Eiffel tower with [Briqs](https://briq.construction/), the brand of Bibliotheca DAO will be front and centre throughout this build. I believe this will give great exposure of Bibliotheca DAO and the further ecosystem to all of France and bring in a huge wave of builders within the Bibliotha DAO ecosystem.

A Briq development of this scale is yet to of been accomplished but coordinating with the DAO and with the further Starknet ecosystem I believe we could produce a world first.

I am invigorated to accomplish a world first in collaboration with the greatest DAO within the Ethereum ecosystem. 

### Character
I am Kevin the lead Brriq designer within the Briq Builders. The Briq Builders are a consortium of builders tied to one another with a love of all thing brick based. We originally built houses in the south of France but have came together to a full Briq based team.

We have past experience in Briq constructions creating such monoliths such as [Stormtrooper](https://unframed.co/item/0x01435498bf393da86b4733b9264a86b58a42b31f8d8b8ba309593e5c17847672/3397729407683568938302343871343992746757725172179994875732006277898251010048), [The "M"](https://unframed.co/item/0x01435498bf393da86b4733b9264a86b58a42b31f8d8b8ba309593e5c17847672/1842236517849756184448639818545312671498069709556804537674595388048411721728) and [Minimal Pepe](https://unframed.co/item/0x01435498bf393da86b4733b9264a86b58a42b31f8d8b8ba309593e5c17847672/1811912121378820551291024701370984384782885702126179583717719098501351079936).
