# Frontinus House Charter
### Frontinus and BibliothecaDAO
The Frontinus House Charter is here to establish a framework in which Frontinus House can work with the BibliothecDAO. The aim of Frontinus House is to establish a way to incentivise teams to work in the BibliothecaDAO ecosystem, fleshing out a living Autonomous World and the infrastructure to maintain that.

Frontinus House Charter is here to build within the constitution of BibliothecaDAO and follow the key aims of Autonomous Worlds - Valuing permissionless, open-source, interoperable and decentralised blockchain protocols.

### The Charter - Rules we must live by
> Frontinus House is a public good

An open-source credibly neutral platform for funding of builders within the Realms Autonomous World and Starknet Ecosystem. This relies on 3 components Frontinus House must adhere to:
-  Immutable onchain protocol
-  Permissionless access
-  Open-source nature
  
Frontinus House specialises within Autonomous Worlds and Fully Onchain Gaming but is not tied to funding within these worlds. Credible neutrality will allow to prop up any ecosystem within the Starknet ecosystem.

Immutability - Frontinus House aims to be an incorruptible mechanism for funding builders as such the protocol aims to run as autonomously as possible, fully onchain without centralised components.

Permissionless - Actors seeking to apply to grants or publish a grant can do so without authorisation.

Opensource - BibliothecaDAO believes in opensource building and at all times will prompt builders to work within an opensource framework.

> Align builders with ecosystems

Frontinus house aims to incentivise builders within autonomous worlds and to be invested within them. We always recommend funding builders with ecosystem tokens over strictly ethereum or stablecoins.

### Builders Constitution
When builders apply for a grant within the Frontinus House Mechanism they **must** act to the standards of the layed out below.

-  Understanding: Builders should ensure they have a complete understanding of the bounty objectives they put forward. They should consider the technical requirements, the desired outcomes, and any constraints specified in the proposal and if they are achievable.
-  Transparency: Builders should be transparent about their skills, experiences, and resources. They should disclose any potential conflicts of interest.
-  Communication: Builders should communicate effectively. They should be prepared to ask questions to clarify bounty requirements and to respond to questions about their proposals.
-  Quality Assurance: Builders should outline their approach to quality assurance and testing in their proposals. They should be prepared to explain how they will ensure any protocol component is robust, secure, and reliable.
-  Compliance: Builders should respect intellectual property rights and other relevant laws and regulations.
-  Risk Management: Builders should clearly identify any potential risks associated with their proposals and describe how they intend to mitigate these risks. This might include risks related to technology, team capacity, funding, or external factors.
-  Feedback: Builders should be open to receiving and responding to feedback on their proposals. They should be prepared to revise their proposals based on feedback from the the funding instigator.
