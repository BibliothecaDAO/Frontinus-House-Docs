The [BIP-80: Change to Emissions Schedule](https://snapshot.box/#/sn:0x07bd3419669f9f0cc8f19e9e2457089cdd4804a4c41a5729ee9c7fd02ab8ab62/proposal/53) signaled the Realms ecosystem’s desire to reduce inflation and simplify the tokenomics of LORDS, the native token of Realms. This new proposal (BIP-84) follows that direction by limiting inflation without imposing overly restrictive measures on the DAO’s future decisions.

### Context
The DAO has expressed a clear desire to reassure LORDS holders that they wish to limit and curb emissions of the LORDS token. While BIP-80 reduced current emissions, it only solved part of the issue. A simple DAO vote could still drastically increase the LORDS supply at any time, posing a risk to both current and prospective holders. By capping the inflation rate, BIP-84 aims to remove that uncertainty.

### What is an Inflation Cap?
BIP-84 proposes to cap the LORDS token’s inflation while keeping ownership under RealmsDAO. This is achieved by locking tokens into an immutable vesting contract that releases at a fixed rate (10% per year) directly into DAO-held multi-sig wallets.

### Summary & Key Points
**DAO Retains Ownership**
- RealmsDAO will still oversee the same total amount of LORDS—it’s just locked and released gradually.

**Predictable Inflation for Holders**
- LORDS holders gain greater confidence in the long-term supply and price dynamics.

**Fixed Annual Expenditure**
- A set vesting schedule forces the DAO to plan its spending more strategically, preventing overspending in any one proposal.

**Flexibility in Allocation**

The tokens vest in twenty tranches, allowing the DAO to:
- Burn LORDS
- Sell part of the treasury OTC
- Adjust staking, veLORDS, or in-game rewards
Note: Liquid LORDS remain subject to the vesting schedule, ensuring the overall inflation cap.

### Why Ten Percent?
This proposal does not claim that 10% is the perfect rate. Rather, it sets a higher ceiling that allows the DAO to adjust downward if needed. 

Discussions among the community have ranged from 0% to 10%, and choosing the higher end leaves room for more conservative (lower) inflation later if RealmsDAO wishes.

### Final Notes
Max Supply: There is a maximum supply of LORDS, which further controls long-term inflation. We cannot infinitely inflate at any fixed rate in perpetuity.

Gradual Taper: While the vesting schedule is set at 10% initially, actual inflation relative to total supply will taper to around 5% as the circulating supply grows. See below real inflation rates year on year.

### Execution
Upon approval of this proposal:

1. Any outstanding liabilities will be moved to the executable account to send or vest immediately to those parties. E.g FH winners funds.
2. All remaining DAO owned LORDS will be put into 20 immutable vesting [Sablier](https://sablier.com/) contracts with a 15 year linear vesting.
3. All vesting amounts will be directed towards DAO account: eth:0xA8e6EFaf015D424c626Cf3C23546Fcb3BD2C9f1a
